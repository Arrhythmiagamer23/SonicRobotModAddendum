# <cj>Sonic Robot Mod</c>

Mod that replaces the robot gamemode (globally, in any level) with a working sprite animation of <cl>Sonic The Hedgehog</c>! As well as adding <cy>Sonic Sound Effects</c> that play on certain in-game events, and are massively customizable!

The mod's settings contain a selection of a bunch of different sprites from a lot of games, like Sonic 1, 2, 3, Mania, even some from fangames! As well as containing an extensive selection of Sound Effects that you can choose from for certain game events, ranging all the way from <cj>Classic Games</c> to the <cb>Modern Era</c> Games! Wanna make them play globally or only disable some of them? Can do! (Includes Sonic Fangames only two are added, more will be added soon!)

You can access the settings via the <cy>mod page</c> or via the game's <cp>pause menu</c>.
<cf>Please make sure to access the mod's settings page so you can configure everything to your liking to make your experience as best as it can be!</c>

<cr>Use **High Graphics** for best visual results!</c>

Just as you know:
You Don't need the original Sonic Robot mod to get the fangame characters, you can get this mod.

The option for the Sonic Cube and Sonic Ball are enabled automatically when loaded for the first time, these options can be turned off anytime.

New Skins:
Tunnel The Mole (From Sonic Galactic)
Sonic (Sonic and The Fallen Star)
More Will be Added Soon! Stay Tuned!
